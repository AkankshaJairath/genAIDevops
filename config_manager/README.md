## 1. Base Class 
ConfigManager:
Handles loading and saving configuration files in both JSON and YAML formats.
Provides methods for backing up, validating, and updating the configuration.
The update_config method takes a key (which can be nested, separated by periods) and a value, and updates the configuration accordingly.
## 2. Derived Classes 
DevConfig, StagingConfig, and ProdConfig:
Inherit from ConfigManager.
Can include specific methods or attributes for each environment.
## 3. Backup and Validation:
backup_config method creates a backup of the existing configuration file.
validate_config method checks for the existence of required keys (this can be extended based on specific validation logic).
## 4. Handling Multiple Formats:
The load_config and save_config methods handle both JSON and YAML formats based on the file extension.
## 5. Update Configuration:
The update_config method updates the configuration with the provided key-value pair, supporting nested keys.
This implementation allows for flexible and automated management of environment-specific configuration files, including updating specific settings based on input key-value pairs.
